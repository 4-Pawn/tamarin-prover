Todo:

- Fix cluster coloring to be consistent (derive from prefix name)

- Check that abbreviator code also considers substrings of already
  abbreviated strings when counting occurrences.

- Work on 'hiding' in-cluster connecting state facts.

- Maybe do dependency sort on abbreviations for order in the end.

- Would be nice if legend appears at bottom.
