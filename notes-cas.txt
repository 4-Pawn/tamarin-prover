- When using -o, some stuff still goes to stderr ("solving goal ...")
  while the case distinctions etc. go to the output file. It would be
  nice to be able to have both in files when needed, or even in the same
  file?

- During a proof, the variant unfolding may do renaming. So suppose I'm
  trying to establish that the peer ($R) must have been compromised
  before the end of the thread to establish a contradiction, and it gets
  renamed to $R305, I might have lost it. 

  Possible solutions: highlight / or retain names for variables in original
  formula.
