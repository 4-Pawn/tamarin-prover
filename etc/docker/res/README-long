The protocol platform consists of:

1. A modified version of tamarin-prover that parses .spthy and, with the -m flag, outputs:

  -m --output-module[=spthy|spthytyped|msr|proverif|deepsec]  What to output:- spthy (including
                                                              processes),- spthy with explicit types,- pure
                                                              msrs (processes translated to msrs) or- DeepSec
                                                              or- ProVerif.

2. Script for convenience:
    proverif-tamarin  .. Translates input file with the modified tamarin-prover and runs proverif on output.
    progsverif-tamarin  .. same for gsverif
    deepsec-tamarin .. same for deepsec
