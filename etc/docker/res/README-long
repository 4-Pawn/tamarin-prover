The protocol platform consists of:

1. A modified version of tamarin-prover that parses .spthy and, with the -m flag, outputs:
```
  -m --output-module[=spthy|spthytyped|msr|proverif|deepsec]  What to output:- spthy (including
                                                              processes),- spthy with explicit types,- pure
                                                              msrs (processes translated to msrs) or- DeepSec
                                                              or- ProVerif.
```
  other important tamarin-flags are:
```
     --prove[=LEMMAPREFIX*|LEMMANAME]                         Attempt to prove all lemmas that start with
                                                              LEMMAPREFIX or the lemma which name is
                                                              LEMMANAME
     -D --defines[=STRING]                                       Define flags for pseudo-preprocessor
     --diff                                                   Turn on observational equivalence mode using
                                                              diff terms
```
    For more details on the command line arguments offered by tamarin-prover, including it's interactive mode, we refer to the official documentation at http://tamarin-prover.github.io/manual/

2. Script for convenience. 

    proverif-tamarin  .. Translates input file with the modified tamarin-prover and runs proverif on output.
    progsverif-tamarin  .. same for gsverif
    deepsec-tamarin .. same for deepsec

    Their usage is `[proverif|progsverif|deepsec]-tamarin file`. They are kept
    simple on purpose - if you need to adjust flags, modify these scripts or
    execute the sequence of commands they describe.

3. Use of macros

    Some of the examples are used by multiple tools. We distinguish which
    lemmas are exported to which tool by using tamarin's builtin macro
    facilities. (Arguably, it would be nicer if the `export` statement would do
    that.) The scripts above and thus our example files use:

    REACH .. for output to proverif / gsverif / tamarin-prover
    PROVERIFEQUIV .. for output only to ProVerif
    DEEPSECEQUIV  .. for output only to  DeepSec

    If tamarin is used directly, the `-D` flag needs to be used to set the
    macros accordingly, see above.
