The protocol platform consists of:

1. A modified version of tamarin-prover that parses .spthy and, with the -m flag, outputs:
```
  -m --output-module[=spthy|spthytyped|msr|proverif|deepsec]  What to output:- spthy (including
                                                              processes),- spthy with explicit types,- pure
                                                              msrs (processes translated to msrs) or- DeepSec
                                                              or- ProVerif.
```
  other important tamarin-flags are:
```
     --prove[=LEMMAPREFIX*|LEMMANAME]                         Attempt to prove all lemmas that start with
                                                              LEMMAPREFIX or the lemma which name is
                                                              LEMMANAME
     -D --defines[=STRING]                                       Define flags for pseudo-preprocessor
     --diff                                                   Turn on observational equivalence mode using
                                                              diff terms
```

2. Script for convenience. 

    proverif-tamarin  .. Translates input file with the modified tamarin-prover and runs proverif on output.
    progsverif-tamarin  .. same for gsverif
    deepsec-tamarin .. same for deepsec

    Their usage is `[proverif|progsverif|deepsec]-tamarin file
