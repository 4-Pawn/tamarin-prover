Hi! This is the protocolplatform Docker image. You can run it two ways:

1. Browse the image interactively:

docker run -it protocolplatform/protocolplatform:latest bash

- execute tamarin-prover, proverif, gsverif, deepse etc. as usual
- execute the scripts below
- Try the examples in /opt/protocolplatform/examples
- Read more detailed instructions in /opt/protocolplatform/README-long

2. Use it on your host:

- set up the following alias to give the image access to your current working
  dir at the time of calling:

alias pp='docker run -v "$PWD:$PWD" -w "$PWD" protocolplatform/protocolplatform'

- run, e.g., "pp tamarin-prover" to run tamarin-prover from the docker
- the protocol-platform is integrated into tamarin-prover, see README-long for details.

The protocol platform consists of:

1. A modified version of tamarin-prover that parses .spthy and, with the -m flag, outputs:

  -m --output-module[=spthy|spthytyped|msr|proverif|deepsec]  What to output:- spthy (including
                                                              processes),- spthy with explicit types,- pure
                                                              msrs (processes translated to msrs) or- DeepSec
                                                              or- ProVerif.

2. Script for convenience:
    proverif-tamarin  .. Translates input file with the modified tamarin-prover and runs proverif on output.
    progsverif-tamarin  .. same for gsverif
    deepsec-tamarin .. same for deepsec
