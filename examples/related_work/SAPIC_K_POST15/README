This example requires the SAPIC tool available at http://sapic.gforge.inria.fr/

Installation for Sapic:
=======================

Installation requires a OCaml programming environment (tested with
OCaml version 4.00.1). The precise version we used, including support for
predicates, can be found in the directory apip-with-predicates.

To compile the tool simply type 'make' in the current directory.

Usage: ./apip [filename]

Example:

	./apip Examples/Basic/running-example.apip > running-example.spthy

will translate the running example described in running-example.apip
in MSR rules (in the tmarin prover input language), redirecting the
output in the file "running-example.spthy" which can be analyzed using
the tamarin-prover.


Installation for the tamarin prover:
====================================

The Sapic heuristic adapted for this very example must be requested, using the
command line parameter --heuristics=P.

Also note that the tamarin prover may output warnings

-----
  WARNING: 1 wellformedness check failed!
           The analysis results might be wrong!
-----

If the input file is produced by the translator and the well-formedness checks
concern only the lookup rules, they can be safely ignored (as was proven in the
long version of the S&P paper describing the theory of this translation).
