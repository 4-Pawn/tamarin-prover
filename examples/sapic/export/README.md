WIP:

 * States/canauth, tpm-bitlocker does not go through with Tamarin
 * privacypass Diff mode does not work on Proverif with a ! at the beginning
 * SSH/WIP, ssh with forwarding does not work in any tool.
 * examples/sapic/fast/feature-locations/SOC.spthy is THE example where Proverif is lost and not Tamarin -> what we are doing is worth it !!!
 * On AC_sid_with_attack, Tamarin find a concrete trace ( in a long time, while Proverif says cannot be proved)
