Before a release, the following things should be checked:

1. run 'make case-studies' and compare 'case-studies/' with
   'case-studies-regression/'

2. run 'tamarin-prover test'

3. generate 'intruder_variants_dh.spthy' and diff with version in data/

4. run 'tamarin-prover interactive examples/csf12' and:
   (a) open one of the presented theories
   (b) try shortcuts (J,K,j,k,1,2,..,a)
   (c) try different graph/sequent options
   (d) try Download

   (e) try 'Loading a new theory' from the start page

5. Bump version number to even minor version and
   (a) make source-dists
   (b) copy

         lib/utils/dist/tamarin-prover-utils.tar.gz
         lib/term/dist/tamarin-prover-termXXXX.tar.gz
         dist/tamarin-prover-XXXX.tar.gz

       to a fresh temporary directory and check that
       theese three compile using

         'cabal-dev install *.tar.gz'

6. Commit version bump, add tag 'tamarin-prover-XXXX' to repository, and merge
   into 'main' branch.

7. Upload all three packages to hackage.
