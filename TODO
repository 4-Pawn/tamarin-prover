                 2011/03/03    SM  Cleanup licencing (e.g., reference GPL-3
                                   once in .cabal file)
                
2011/10/01  SM   2011/09/28    SM  Use precomputed cases for MsgEdges
                                   Check for False being derived
                
2012/01/01  SM   2011/10/03    CC  If dh-proto-proof is invoked in the wrong
	                           directory (e.g. examples) the intruder rules are not
	                           loaded, but the user is not warned.
                
2011/10/03  SM   2011/10/03    CC  Case splits with more than 10 cases get
                                   sorted in the wrong way, i.e., case_10 comes
                                   before case_2 because of the lexicographic
                                   ordering. Possible solution: prefix with the
                                   appropriate amount of zeroes depending on the
                                   number of cases (yielding, e.g., case_02) so
                                   that the ordering works again.
                
2012/01/01  SM   2011/10/03    SM  WF checks for: *-restricted, protocol rules, 
                                   and properties.
                
                 2011/10/03    SM  Cas suggested to use a status-popup when a
                                   branch is solved and the prover jumps to the
                                   next open goal in the interface.

                 2011/10/04    CC  The equation splits often yield many
		                   cases and it would be interesting to be able to
		                   quickly see which branch belongs to which equation.
		                   I imagine annotation (just as is done now with some
		                   other text):

		                     case split_case_02 // x = y^z

2012/01/01  SM   2011/10/26    SM  Switch fact notation to paper. 
                                   Send ~> Out, Knows ~> In, Fresh ~> Fr

                                   OK. Add exactly case studies to data files
                                   - Write tutorial.spthy and integrate it
                                     with the help message.
                                   OK. Make case studies easily executable.

                2012/02/08     SM  Normalize graph numberings as good as
                                   possible.

                                   Better attack visualization: put into box
                                   when prefix of fact the same and connected
                                   by an edge, then this is the same thread.

                2012/02/09     SM  Add a theory info node for signature and E.

                2012/02/08     SM  Implement satisfiable/valid.

                2012/02/09     SM  Allow selecting the 'dot' tool for
                                   interactive mode.

                2012/02/09     SM  Easy simplifications:
                                     - remove disprovable top-level atoms in
                                       disjunctions, like we do in the
                                       equation store.
                                     - tell equation store about what terms
                                       must be in normal form and use this
                                       information to simplify the equations.

                2012/02/19     SM  Fix broken intruder variants computation.

                2012/02/22     SM  Cleanup built-in rules: there should be one
                                   precise location that we get them from.
                                   currently, this seems to be spread over
                                   quite some code. For sure: fix
                                   AbstractInterpretation to refer to
                                   built-in rules.

                2012/02/23     SM  Once we switched to the github repository
                                   make sure that --version also reports a
                                   uniquely identifiable commit. This
                                   simplifies debugging greatly.
