                 2011/03/03    SM  Cleanup licencing (e.g., reference GPL-3
                                   once in .cabal file)
                
2011/10/01  SM   2011/09/28    SM  Use precomputed cases for MsgEdges
                                   Check for False being derived
                
2012/01/01  SM   2011/10/03    CC  If dh-proto-proof is invoked in the wrong
	                           directory (e.g. examples) the intruder rules are not
	                           loaded, but the user is not warned.
                
2011/10/03  SM   2011/10/03    CC  Case splits with more than 10 cases get
                                   sorted in the wrong way, i.e., case_10 comes
                                   before case_2 because of the lexicographic
                                   ordering. Possible solution: prefix with the
                                   appropriate amount of zeroes depending on the
                                   number of cases (yielding, e.g., case_02) so
                                   that the ordering works again.
                
2012/01/01  SM   2011/10/03    SM  WF checks for: *-restricted, protocol rules, 
                                   and properties.
                
                 2011/10/03    SM  Cas suggested to use a status-popup when a
                                   branch is solved and the prover jumps to the
                                   next open goal in the interface.

                 2011/10/04    CC  The equation splits often yield many
		                   cases and it would be interesting to be able to
		                   quickly see which branch belongs to which equation.
		                   I imagine annotation (just as is done now with some
		                   other text):

		                     case split_case_02 // x = y^z
